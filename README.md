## About The Project

This project goes beyond a standard chatbot by implementing a "tool-enabled" AI architecture. The Gemini model is equipped with a set of functions that allow it to access live information and perform real-world actions. The AI intelligently analyzes the user's prompt and decides which tool to use, if any, to provide the most accurate and up-to-date response.

This demonstrates a modern, agent-based approach to building AI applications that can interact with external systems.
